       "'To move your stop loss to breakeven after the first take profit is hit in your strategy, you can create a function using the `adjust_func_nb` feature. In this function, you need to set a condition to check if the first take profit has been hit. This can be done using the `vbt.pf_nb.is_stop_info_ladder_active_nb` function and `tp_info[\"step\"]` where `tp_info` holds the information about the take profit. If the first take profit is hit (i.e., `tp_info[\"step\"] == 0`), you adjust your stop loss to the entry price, effectively moving your stop loss to breakeven. Here is an example code snippet:\\n\\n```python\\n@njit\\ndef adjust_func_nb(c, atr, multipliers, exit_sizes):\\n    tp_info = c.last_tp_info[c.col]\\n    if vbt.pf_nb.is_stop_info_ladder_active_nb(tp_info):\\n        if tp_info[\"step\"] == 0:  # first take profit hit\\n            sl_info = c.last_sl_info[c.col]\\n            sl_info.stop = tp_info[\"entry_price\"]  # adjust stop loss to entry price (breakeven)\\n        if np.isnan(tp_info[\"stop\"]):\\n            step = tp_info[\"step\"]\\n            init_atr = vbt.pf_nb.select_nb(c, atr, i=tp_info[\"init_idx\"])\\n            tp_info[\"stop\"] = init_atr * multipliers[step]\\n            tp_info[\"delta_format\"] = vbt.pf_enums.DeltaFormat.Absolute\\n            tp_info[\"exit_size\"] = exit_sizes[step]\\n            tp_info[\"exit_size_type\"] = vbt.pf_enums.SizeType.Percent\\n```\\n\\nRemember, this is a high-level example and you may need to modify it based on the specifics of your code and strategy.'"
